## Testing MDX Features

So I've been working on this blog for a while now, and I wanted to test out all the MDX features I've added. Here's a quick rundown:

### Code Blocks

Here's some TypeScript I wrote the other day:

```typescript
function calculateStuff(x: number): number {
    return x * Math.PI; // because why not
}
```

And some CSS I'm not sure about:

```css
.weird-button {
    background: conic-gradient(from 45deg, #ff0000, #00ff00, #0000ff);
    transform: skew(10deg);
    /* Is this too much? */
}
```

### Lists and Stuff

List of things:
- What
- is 
- this 
- list 

List 2: Electric Boogaloo
1. This
2. is
3. a
4. list

Things I need to do:
- [x] Fix that annoying bug
- [ ] Write more blog posts
- [ ] Stop procrastinating on Twitter
- [x] Add MDX support

### Blockquotes

> Sometimes I just need to quote myself because I'm that profound
> 
> -- Me, probably

### Tables

| Framework | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Next.js   | Using  | Pretty good |
| Astro     | Tried  | Interesting |
| Remix     | Maybe? | On the list |

### Inline Stuff

You can do *italic* and **bold** and even ***both***. And if you're feeling fancy, you can `code` inline too.

That's about it for now. Might add more features later if I feel like it. Or not. We'll see.

P.S. Here's another song I've been listening to while coding:
