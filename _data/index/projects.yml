    I'm developing software to predict the outcome of contractual damage litigation to benefit academics in debates, parties in drafting contracts,
    counsels in their pre-trial exchanges and judges in assisting their rulings. I am using NLP to extract information from online legal databases and ML
    techniques to design the prediction model.

    I built a deep learning based architecture to improve session-based recommendations for e-commerce scenarios where user profiles are invisible
    using an attention mechanism and context information about the user's actions. Achieved significant improvements in Recall@20 and MRR@20 scores
    over the present baseline methods on the YouChoose dataset.

    I designed and implemented a Generative Adversarial Network model called PictoGAN that can play Pictionary.
    I modeled multi-class data from the Quick, Draw! dataset to allow the generator network to produce output similar to human drawings of different objects.

    I developed a Django web app to pull information from various services like YouTube, Wikipedia, Twitter and Reddit
    based on searches, and make recommendations using AWS DynamoDB and Lambda.
    I designed content-based and collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems and AWS Cognito for credential management
    and trained the model on Apache Spark with the Alternating Least Squares algorithm.

    I developed a Customer Service chatbot, an iOS application that included facial verification, and allowed users to have complete conversations
     with a bot for booking a cab, a hotel or a parking spot.
    I built the service using AWS frameworks like Rekognition, Lex, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, Kinesis, DynamoDB, S3 and Elastic Beanstalk.

    I led the team working to develop an artificially intelligent system that can detect objects posing as a security threat in environments under surveillance.
    I designed a Python-based supervised learning algorithm on a CUDA-Theano-Keras backbone.
    I trained the CNN on a 60k CIFAR-10 dataset and tested it on optimally extracted frames from videos to achieve an accuracy of 80%.
    I prepared proposals and made presentations for funding and review and presented at the Student Research Symposium 2017, IIT Indore.
